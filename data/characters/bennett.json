    "description": "The few young adventurers that the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild has always find themselves tangled up in baffling bouts of bad luck. He is the only active member of his own adventure group, known as \"Benny's Adventure Team,\" after all the other members decided to \"take leave\" following a series of unfortunate incidents. As a result, the team is currently on the verge of being dissolved. Being unable to break the poor boy's heart, Katheryne of the Adventurers' Guild has kept \"Benny's Adventure Team\" on the books, whilst also hiding from him the fact that all the other members have long since officially left the team.",
